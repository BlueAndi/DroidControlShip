## What is ROS 2?
ROS 2 is the second major version of the Robot Operating System (ROS), an open-source framework to build complex robot applications.

Key features of ROS 2 include:
- Distributed Computing: Nodes can be distributed across multiple machines.
- Real-Time Capabilities: Improved support for real-time systems.
- Cross-Platform: Runs on various operating systems, including Linux, Windows, and macOS.
- Modularity: Encourages modularity and reusability of code.

## What has improved since ROS 1
Major advancements from ROS (1) include improved real-time capability, more generic Data Distribution Service (DDS) than previously used TCPROS/UDPROS protocols.

List of key differences and new features:
- Middleware: ROS 2 uses DDS for better performance and QoS.
- Real-Time Support: ROS 2 offers enhanced real-time capabilities.
- Cross-Platform: ROS 2 supports multiple operating systems and RTOS.
- Distributed Computing: ROS 2 enables distributed node execution.
- QoS: ROS 2 provides extensive QoS settings.
- Lifecycle Management: ROS 2 introduces lifecycle management for nodes.
- API Stability: ROS 2 emphasizes stable and versioned APIs.
- Security: ROS 2 includes initial security features.
- Development Tools: ROS 2 builds on the ROS 1 ecosystem with new tools.

## What is micro-ROS?
micro-ROS brings ROS 2 to microcontrollers, allowing developers to run ROS 2 applications on resource-constrained devices. This extension enables the integration of microcontrollers into ROS 2 networks, making it possible to create more complex and distributed robotic systems.

Key features of micro-ROS include:
- [Small Footprint](https://micro.ros.org/docs/concepts/benchmarking/memo_prof/): Optimized for microcontrollers with limited resources.
- [Real-Time Capabilities](https://micro.ros.org/docs/concepts/rtos/): Supports real-time operation on microcontrollers.
- [ROS 2 Compatibility](https://micro.ros.org/docs/overview/ROS_2_feature_comparison/): Fully compatible with ROS 2, allowing seamless integration with larger ROS 2 systems. See 
- [Cross-Platform](https://micro.ros.org/docs/overview/hardware/): Supports a variety of microcontroller platforms and RTOS (Real-Time Operating Systems).

## External micro-ROS build system
micro-ROS supports a variety of external build system beyond the micro_ros_setup tool such as PlatformIO [micro_ros_platformio](https://github.com/micro-ROS/micro_ros_platformio/). The following component diagram depi

# ROS 2 in DCS
This section describes the integration of micro-ROS in the existing workspace, extending it by implementing a ROS 2 node and the micro-ROS stack. The goal is to connect the ZumoComSystem with the DDS network using DDS-XRCE, making the robot controllable via ROS messages to mimic turtle graphics drawing using the robot.
