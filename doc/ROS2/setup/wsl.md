# Installation of WSL for ROS2 Jazzy

Each ROS2 distribution targets a specific Linux environment. 
For Jazzy it is *Ubuntu 24.04*. To run it on Windows 10/11, 
the WSL2 feature will be used. 

## Install WSL 
Installing WSL (Linux on Windows) is officially supported by Microsoft.
For details refer to the following
[Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).

But all you need is this from a windows power shell:

```bat
    wsl --install -d "Ubuntu-24.04"
```

> **_NOTE:_**
A Windows message dialog may popup in the background, to ask for elevated rights. 
Check for such a window if the installation does not progress.

## First time use
A console window should appear with installation messages. At the it will ask you
for a user name and password. Use values your remember as you need this password
later whenever you install software.
