The Droid Control Ship contains different kind of applications, used for educational purposes:

* Convoy Leader Robot - Based on odometry information, it leads the followers to follow like a lemming trail.
* Convoy Follower Robot - It follows the leader by mainly reacting on the received information.
* etc.

It is designed to run on the [ZumoComSystem](https://github.com/NewTec-GmbH/ZumoComSystem) hardware, which is a shield for the [Pololu 32U4 Zumo Robot](https://www.pololu.com/product/2510).

![RobotWithZumoComSystem](doc/images/RobotWithZumoComSystem.jpg)

It supports running in the [Webots simulation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) too.

The Droid Control Ship communicates with the [Radon Ulzer](https://github.com/BlueAndi/RadonUlzer).

## The target

The main target of the firmware is the [ZumoComSystem](https://github.com/NewTec-GmbH/ZumoComSystem) from NewTec GmbH, which is a shield for the [Pololu 32U4 Zumo Robot](https://www.pololu.com/product/2510).

Together with [Radon Ulzer](https://github.com/BlueAndi/RadonUlzer) it can be run in the [Webots simulation](https://www.cyberbotics.com/) too.

## The simulation

The simulation is based on the open source robot simulator *Webots*. The application and the services are equal to the target firmware. Only the HAL is different in the simulation.
